Instructions:

In order to get these Eclipse Projects up and running (presummably having checked everything out), you have to run the eclipse goal per project like SampleApplication for example:
cd SampleApplication
mvn eclipse:eclipse

Once that's done, open eclipse pointing at the eejava workspace location... e.g: /work/eejava

If you have checkout out eejava into a working eclipse template (with Java 1.7 and Tomcat already set up) then proceed.

Import selected projects (that have had the eclipse goal executed) into the workspace.

In the case of the SampleApplication which is a JSF project, we have to set up some facets as follows (project properties / project facets):
java (should already be selected)
Dynamic Web Module
JSF - configure further and add Mojarra

Once this is all done, test by selecting a entry webpage like login.xhtml -> run as -> run on server...

All going well, this should open up within eclipse displaying your apps page.

----

Servlet applications are a little easier, simply add the Dynamic Web Module facet and test the same way by selecting a web page to execute.
